After some probing from Brayden and my affinity to learn random things, when I stumbled across the wirecutter's review of ukuleles, I bookmarked it and waited for the price to drop.  I found a lightning deal with a coupon for the recommended [beginner uke from Donner](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01M1L6OSX).

In anticipation, I found a good beginner site on learning and some basics.  [p1](http://willgrovewhite.com/learning-to-play-the-ukulele-lesson-one/), [p2](http://willgrovewhite.com/learning-to-play-the-ukulele-lesson-two/), [p3](http://willgrovewhite.com/learning-to-play-the-ukulele-lesson-three/)

After that, I picked a song or two that I wanted to learn.  Having a little bit of good practice of basic chords and strumming patterns.  I started with [Vance Joy - Riptide](https://liveukulele.com/songs/riptide-vance-joy/).  I had to reference a [youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=98OyES12wIM) to help with the strumming pattern.

Next I wanted to do our wedding song, [Lucky by Jason Mraz & Colbie Caillat](http://ukulelecheats.com/jason-mraz-lucky-ukulele-chords/).  Again, strumming was tough, but I got it with this, [not great youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMIkRFbm6nc), but proved to be helpful.
