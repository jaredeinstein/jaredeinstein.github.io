title: GitHub Pages

In the interest of me liking to learn new things, this seems to be a good place to log them.

I have always liked the idea of hosting a website, but am too cheap to pay because I don't have a valid purpose for it.  I have hosted a site with GitHub Pages before, but it was a very basic site with one HTML page with a little bit of fancy CSS and Javascript.

Upon recent investigation, GitHub Pages support a pretty extensive suite of built in site development.  It was at least unique and something I wanted to investigate, and learn more about.

This post will be dedicated to some of the resources I used to make this site, and lessons learned along the way.
