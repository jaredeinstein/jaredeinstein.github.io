memento mori
:There is a confluence of ideas in Christian theology and Stoic philosophy, summarized in the Latin phrase, *memento mori*. It means “remember that you will die”.
:Too often, philosophical truths are treated as esoteric, but I believe they should always have practical application. At first glance, the instruction to contemplate your death is morbid and depressing. It could create a sense of futility or even nihilism. But for me, memento mori is a call to action. **If our time is finite and our physical presence fleeting, then we are charged to do as much as we can with what little we have.** When life is viewed through the lens of our inevitable, impending, and unpredictable death, there isn’t time to do things that don’t matter.
