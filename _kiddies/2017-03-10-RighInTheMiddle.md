title: right in the middle
---

Brayden is jumping in the bathtub after being told not to jump in the bathtub. He falls on a plastic, swimming duck and starts to cry.  
  
__Brayden__: Mommy, I fell.  Can you kiss it?  
  
Brayden then hangs his behind over the side of the tub.  Mommy, while laughing, kisses his hip.  

__Mommy__:  All better.  
__Brayden__: (still crying) No!  Kiss it where it hurts, right in the middle, where the poop comes out.  

Commence uncontrollable laughter.  
  
The crying has subsided.  Brayden picks up the duck.  
  
__Brayden__:  I must have fallen right on the bill.
