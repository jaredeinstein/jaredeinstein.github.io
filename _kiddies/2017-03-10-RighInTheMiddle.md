title: right in the middle
---

Kid1 is jumping in the bathtub after being told not to jump in the bathtub. He falls on a plastic, swimming duck and starts to cry.  
  
__Kid1__: Mommy, I fell.  Can you kiss it?  
  
Kid1 then hangs his behind over the side of the tub.  Mommy, while laughing, kisses his hip.  

__Mommy__:  All better.  
__Kid1__: (still crying) No!  Kiss it where it hurts, right in the middle, where the poop comes out.  

Commence uncontrollable laughter.  
  
The crying has subsided.  Kid1 picks up the duck.  
  
__Kid1__:  I must have fallen right on the bill.
