title: make your bed?
---

__Kid1__:  Dad, can you please put my book back in the blue chair?  I like to keep my room tidy.  
__Dad__:  I know you do.  That is great.  I love that about you.  I also like to keep my things tidy.  
__Kid1__:  Do you think maybe you should make your bed then tomorrow?
