title: ask nicely
---

Kid2 has gotten down from the dinner table to get briefly play with toys three times already.  Dad is finally putting a stop to it.  He grabs her and puts her firmly back in her chair.

__Dad__:  It is time to stop getting down from the dinner table.  Now sit down and eat your dinner.
__Kid2__:  Ask nicely!

Dad takes a deep breath.  Patience have thoroughly been tested.  But Kid1 does this as a last ditch effort to "get his way", so clearly this is Kid2 copying, but will also listen after getting her last dig in.  Reluctantly, hoping she'll cooperate.

__Dad__:  OK.  Please!  Will you sit nicely and eat your dinner?
__Kid2__:  NO!
