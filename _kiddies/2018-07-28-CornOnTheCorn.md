title: corn on the corn
---

The only thing holding the whole family back from having a nice, cool, frozen dessert out on the float is finishing dinner.  The parents are excited.  The kids are excited.

Dinner is served.

Kid2 immediately starts crying hysterically.

__Kid2__:  (unintelligible crying)  
__Dad__:  Kid2, you need to take a deep breath.  Stop crying.  And use your words please.
__Kid2__:  (unintelligible crying)  

This went on for about 5 more minutes, before we got it out.

__Kid2__:  (while still sobbing egregiously) I WANT THE CORN ON THE CORN!
__Dad__:  Kid2, it was frozen corn, from a bag.  It was never on the cob.

We showed Kid2 the empty bag.  We said we would buy corn on the cob this week for dinner.

Commence crying for another 10 full minutes.

__Kid2__:  BUT I WANT THE CORN ON THE CORN!
