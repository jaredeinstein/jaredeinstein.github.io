Ingredients
-----------

* **For the Dry Brine:**
* 1 whole chicken (3 pounds), washed, patted dry, and cut into quarters
* 1 tablespoon kosher salt
* 1 1/2 teaspoons freshly ground black pepper

* **For the Dip:**
* 1 cup whole milk
* 2 large eggs
* 1 tablespoon Louisiana-style hot sauce

* **For the Dredge:**
* 2 cups all-purpose flour
* 2 teaspoons sea salt
* Vegetable oil, for frying

* **For the Spicy Coating:**
* 1/2 cup lard, melted and heated (or hot frying oil)
* 3 tablespoons cayenne pepper
* 1 tablespoon (packed) light brown sugar
* 1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
* 3/4 teaspoon sea salt
* 1/2 teaspoon paprika
* 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder


Directions
----------

1. **Dry brine the chicken**: In a bowl, toss the chicken pieces with salt and pepper, cover, and refrigerate overnight or up to 24 hours.

2. **Make the dip and dredge**: In a bowl, whisk together the milk, eggs, and hot sauce. In a separate bowl, whisk together the flour and salt.

3. **Dredge the chicken**: Dip the chicken in the flour mixture, then in the milk mixture, then in the flour mixture again, shaking off the excess after each step.

4. **Fry the chicken**: Fill a 6- to 8-quart pot halfway with oil and to 325Â°F. Set a wire rack on top of a rimmed baking sheet and set aside. Working in batches, lower the chicken into the fryer and fry until crisp, 15 to 17 minutes for breast quarters and 18 to 20 minutes for leg quarters. Remove the chicken and let drain on the rack.

5. **Make the spicy coating**: Carefully ladle the lard or frying oil into a medium heatproof bowl and whisk in the cayenne pepper, brown sugar, black pepper, salt, paprika, and garlic powder. Baste the spice mixture over the hot fried chicken and serve immediately.
