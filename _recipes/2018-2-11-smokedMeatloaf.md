Directions
----------

1. Combine all ingredients for meatloaf in a large bowl and mix thoroughly but gently. Overmixing will create a meatloaf with a tight, sausage-like consistency—not all bad, but not light like the meat-cloud we’re looking for.Mix the meatloaf gently to combine

2. Preheat your smoker to 225°F (107°C). Form your meat into a tightly packed loaf on a half sheet pan or cookie sheet.Form the meatloaf firmly

3. Set up your ThermaQ WiFi and place your probes. Place the meat probe in the very middle—the thermal center—of the loaf for greatest accuracy in cooking. Use the grate clip to place your air probe near the grates surface of your smoker.

4. Set your air probe high alarm to 240°F (116°C) and the low alarm to 210°F (99°C) to make sure your smoker temperature stays steady.

5. Set your meat probe high alarm to 120°F (49°C) and place the meatloaf in the smoker.

6. Meanwhile, prepare the glaze by mixing all glaze ingredients in a bowl.making glaze for smoked meatloaf

7. When the meat temperature reaches its target and the high alarm sounds, brush generously with glaze.

8. Reset your meat probe high alarm to 160°F (71°C) and continue cooking.Baste the meatloaf with the glaze

9. When the meat probe high alarm sounds again and the ThermaQ reads 160°F (71°C), verify your temperatures with your Thermapen Mk4 by sticking it through to the bottom and slowly pulling it up through the loaf.

10. If your lowest temp is 160°F (71°C), take it off the smoker and let it rest a few minutes before serving. This will allow the carryover cooking to bring the temp the rest of the way up to 165°F (74°C) and will allow the juices to re-settle into the meat.Check the temperature with an instant-read thermometer

11. Slice, serve, and know that you’re now the king or queen of the tailgate.
