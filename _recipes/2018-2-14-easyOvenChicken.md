Ingredients
-----------

* Butter or olive oil
* Boneless, skinless chicken breast
* Salt and pepper
* Other spices or seasonings


Directions
----------

1. Heat the oven to 400째F and prepare the pan: Heat the oven to 400째F with a rack in the middle position. Rub the pan and one side of the parchment paper with butter or olive oil; this prevents the chicken from sticking.

2. Prepare the chicken: Pat the chicken dry and rub with a little butter or olive oil, if desired. Sprinkle with salt, pepper, and any other favorite seasonings.

3. Transfer to the baking dish: Place the chicken breasts in the baking dish, spaced slightly apart. You can also tuck herbs or lemon wedges around the chicken for extra flavor.

4. Cover with the parchment: Lay the parchment, butter-side down, over the chicken. Tuck the edges into the pan and press the parchment down so that it's snug around the chicken. The chicken breasts should be completely covered with the parchment.

5. Bake until the chicken is 165째F: Transfer the chicken to the oven until the chicken is completely opaque all the way through and registers 165째F on an instant-read thermometer. Start checking after 20 minutes; total cooking time is usually 30 to 40 minutes.

6. Serve: Serve the chicken immediately, or let it cool and refrigerate for up to a week.
